The error is not because of the requirements.txt file . The pipeline is failing because it canâ€™t download the fiservai package from GitHub. This might be a network or SSL issue on the build server. The server may not be able to access GitHub to install that package.
his is my understanding and this is not a problem with the requirements.txt file.
Please correct me if I am wrong.
